Reminder browser
================

Usage
-----

Run `node tools/browser` from the root directory. `node .` works too if you're in
the `tools/browser` directory.

Like the main app you can specify a profile directory with a command line
parameter `--profile`. This is where the database lives in a file
`reminders_v2.db`.


Keys and focus
--------------
In the main panels, `<TAB>` moves focus between the main table at the top and
the 2 subtables at the bottom.

The left and right arrow keys move between the left and right tables.

`<ENTER>` displays the information about the highlighted object in fullscreen.

`<ESC>` moves back to the previous screen/

`Q` exits.
